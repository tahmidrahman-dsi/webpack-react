# Webpack react

Just practice react without ES6 and with some very basic webpack config. I also used a mixin here but please note that in case of ES6, you might not want to use mixins because [mixins considered harmful](https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html).

Run `npm install` to install deps and then `npm start` to run the project.
